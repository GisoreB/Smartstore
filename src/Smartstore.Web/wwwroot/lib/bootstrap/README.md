# Customized Bootstrap Framework

Our customized Bootstrap framework is a hybrid solution that strategically combines features from both Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5. This fusion is tailored to meet the specific requirements of our software without altering the core CSS class names. It's important to note that we have not made any modifications to the JavaScript files provided by Bootstrap; only SCSS has been customized. The primary objective is to maintain compatibility with the original Bootstrap documentation for developer convenience.

Key Points:
----------------------------------------

1. **Hybrid Framework**: Our framework integrates selected features from Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 to leverage the advantages of each version while ensuring a seamless transition between the two.

2. **Preservation of CSS Class Names**: We have made a deliberate choice not to modify CSS class names. This decision enables developers to continue referencing the standard Bootstrap documentation without confusion.

3. **Customized CSS**: We have made individual customizations to CSS components, styles, and behaviors to align with our software's specific requirements.
