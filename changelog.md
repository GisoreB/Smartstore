  - Significantly less memory consumption (approx. 50%)
  - Even low-cost (cloud) hosting delivers high performance
- Powerful **DataGrid** in the backend
  - Developed in-house, no more 3rd party libaries with annoying license restrictions

  - Search filter expressions: run complex search queries, e.g. `(*jacket or *shirt) and !leather*`

### Development

- No proprietary Unit of Work & Repository Pattern anymore: gave up `IDbContext` and `IRepository<T>` in favor of `DbContext` and `DbSet<T>`
- Less and more lightweight service classes by removing all generic CRUD stuff
- Much easier plugin development
- Async function calls all the way through
- Database schema did not change and therefore remains backward compatible. Still we STRONGLY recommend to create a backup before upgrading
- Extremely powerful widget system
- Large TagHelper library with 50+ custom helpers
- On-demand deployment of native libraries via NuGet
- Custom entities in plugin projects can now define navigation properties to entities in the application core
