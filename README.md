### Upgrade from Smartstore.NET 4.2

Smartstore 5 is a port of [Smartstore.NET 4](https://github.com/smartstore/SmartStoreNET) - based on the classic .NET Framework 4.7.2 – to the new `ASP.NET Core 7` platform. Smartstore instances based on classic `ASP.NET MVC` can be upgraded seamlessly. To [upgrade](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SMNET50/pages/1956118609/Updating+from+Previous+Versions), all you need to do is replace the application files on your server - except for the `App_Data` directory - and **all your data will automatically be transferred to the new system**. [See the documentation for detailed information on installing or upgrading your store](https://smartstore.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SMNET50/pages/1956118822/Installing+Smartstore).

 :information_source: Upgrading from versions older than 4.2 is not possible. Therefore, you should migrate Smartstore.NET to version 4.2 first and then upgrade to Smartstore 5.

### Visual Studio

- Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore.git` and checkout the `main` branch.
- Download Visual Studio 2022 (any edition) from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
- Open `Smartstore.sln` and wait for Visual Studio to restore all NuGet packages
- Make sure `Smartstore.Web` is the startup project and run it

### Repository Structure

- [`Smartstore`](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/tree/main/src/Smartstore) contains common low-level application-agnostic stuff like bootstrapper, modularity engine, caching, pub/sub, imaging, type conversion, IO, templating, scheduling, various utilities, common extension methods etc.
- [`Smartstore.Data`](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/tree/main/src/Smartstore.Data) contains database providers
- [`Smartstore.Core`](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/tree/main/src/Smartstore.Core) contains application specific modules like catalog, checkout, identity, security, localization, logging, messaging, rules engine, search engine, theme engine, migrations etc.
- [`Smartstore.Web.Common`](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/tree/main/src/Smartstore.Web.Common) contains common web features like custom MVC infrastructure, bundling, TagHelpers, HtmlHelpers etc.
- [`Smartstore.Modules`](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/tree/main/src/Smartstore.Modules) contains all module/plugin projects
- [`Smartstore.Web`](https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/tree/main/src/Smartstore.Web) is the entry host project that contains controllers, model classes, themes, static assets etc.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Build Smartstore

### Option 1 - by publishing the entry host project

1. Open the Smartstore solution in Visual Studio 2022
2. Use **Release** configuration
3. (Re)build the solution
4. Publish host project **Smartstore.Web**

### Option 2 - by running a build script

Run the build script corresponding to your target platform in the **build** directory: `build.{Platform}.cmd`. The resulting build will be placed in the `build/artifacts/Community.{Version}.{Platform}` directory. A zip archive in **build/artifacts/** is created automatically.

By default, the build script produces a platform-specific, self-contained application that includes the ASP.NET runtime and libraries, the Smartstore application and its dependencies. You can run it on any machine that doesn't have the .NET runtime installed.

Smartstore uses Nuke (https://nuke.build/) as its build automation solution, which makes it easy to customize the build process by editing `src/Smartstore.Build/Smartstore.Build/Build.cs`.

### About the "src/Smartstore.Web/Modules" directory

While building the solution, all modules in `src/Smartstore.Modules/` are detected, compiled and placed in the `src/Smartstore.Web/Modules/` directory. The application runtime uses this directory as a source from which modules are 
loaded dynamically. During development, however, the "Modules" directory is irrelevant. You can safely delete it at any time.

### Creating Docker images

To create a Docker image, run `build/dockerize.{Platform}[.nobuild].sh`.

##### dockerize.linux.sh

Creates a Debian Linux base image including the complete ASP.NET runtime, builds the solution and publishes a framework-dependent application inside the Linux container. It also installs the native **wkhtmltopdf** library needed to generate PDF files.

##### dockerize.linux.nobuild.sh

Much faster, but requires that the application has already been built and is located in `build/artifacts/Community.{Version}.linux-x64`. Creates a Debian Linux base image with only the ASP.NET runtime dependencies and copies the build artifact. It also installs the native **wkhtmltopdf** library needed to generate PDF files.

##### dockerize.windows.nobuild.sh

Creates a Windows Nano Server base image with only the ASP.NET runtime dependencies and copies the build artifact. Requires that the application has already been built and is located in `build/artifacts/Community.{Version}.win-x64`. It also requires that the Docker engine is running a Windows image.

### Creating Docker containers

To create a ready-to-run Docker container with a database server run `compose.{DbSystem}.sh`. 

##### compose.mysql.sh

Creates a composite Docker container containing the **smartstore** application image and the latest **MySql** image.

##### compose.sqlserver.sh

Creates a composite Docker container containing the **smartstore** application image and the latest **MS SQL Server** image.
